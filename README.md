# MLDoc: A Corpus for Multilingual Document Classification in Eight Languages
This script generates a subset of the Reuters corpus with balanced class priors for eight languages. By adding Italian, Russian, Japanese and Chinese, we cover languages which are very different with respect to syntax, morphology, etc. See our paper for benchmark results on this dataset.
